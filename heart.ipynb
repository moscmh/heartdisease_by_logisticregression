Fourteen attributes from original 76 are available for training. They will be examined about the effectiveness of predicting and relationship with the response variable ranging from 0 (absence of heart disease) to 4 (different categories of presence heart disease). The published accuracy of logistic regression reaches up to **89.474%** and **91.108%** for precision."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["from ucimlrepo import fetch_ucirepo\n","# import dataset\n","heart_disease = fetch_ucirepo(id=45)\n","# alternatively: fetch_ucirepo(name='Heart Disease')\n","\n","# access data\n","X = heart_disease.data.features\n","y = heart_disease.data.targets"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The available predictors are listed as follows."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 303 entries, 0 to 302\n","Data columns (total 13 columns):\n"," #   Column    Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n","---  ------    --------------  -----  \n"," 0   age       303 non-null    int64  \n"," 1   sex       303 non-null    int64  \n"," 2   cp        303 non-null    int64  \n"," 3   trestbps  303 non-null    int64  \n"," 4   chol      303 non-null    int64  \n"," 5   fbs       303 non-null    int64  \n"," 6   restecg   303 non-null    int64  \n"," 7   thalach   303 non-null    int64  \n"," 8   exang     303 non-null    int64  \n"," 9   oldpeak   303 non-null    float64\n"," 10  slope     303 non-null    int64  \n"," 11  ca        299 non-null    float64\n"," 12  thal      301 non-null    float64\n","dtypes: float64(3), int64(10)\n","memory usage: 30.9 KB\n"]}],"source":["X.info()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Remarks:  \n","* cp: Chest pain types  \n","* trestbps: resting blood pressure  \n","* chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl  \n","* fbs: fasting blood sugar  \n","* restecg: resting electrocardiographic results  \n","* thalach: maximum heart rate achieved  \n","* exang: exercise induced angina  \n","* oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest  \n","* slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment  \n","* ca: number of major vessels colored by flourosopy\n","* thal: thalassemia"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":".venv","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.6"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
